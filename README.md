This GitHub repository contains the source code and datasets used in the research paper, "Improving Spatial Resolution and Accuracy of Global Digital Elevation Models for Flood Modeling Using Deep Learning-Based Integration of Remote Sensing Data." The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to generate high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) by leveraging multi-source data, including GDEMs, remote imagery data (Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2), and OpenStreetMap layers. This method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) U-Net model to integrate and refine these diverse data sources, producing enhanced DEMs at a 5-meter resolution. This approach significantly improves the accuracy and resolution of global DEMs, leading to more precise models essential for urban flood management and simulations.

# Key Contributions
- A high-resolution DEM was developed for urban flood modeling using deep learning-based multi-source data integration.
- The enhanced DEM significantly improved accuracy, showing reductions in RMSE and MAE, and detailed urban feature representation.
- The improved DEM demonstrated better flood pattern accuracy by increasing detection probability and reducing false alarms.
