# Improving Spatial Resolution and Accuracy of Global Digital Elevation Models for Flood Modeling Using Deep Learning-Based Integration of Remote Sensing Data 

# Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code and datasets used in the research paper, "Improving Spatial Resolution and Accuracy of Global Digital Elevation Models for Flood Modeling Using Deep Learning-Based Integration of Remote Sensing Data ." The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to generate high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) by leveraging multi-source data, including GDEMs, remote imagery data (Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2), and OpenStreetMap layers. This method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) U-Net model to integrate and refine these diverse data sources, producing enhanced DEMs at a 5-meter resolution.
